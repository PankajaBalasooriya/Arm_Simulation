[0.589s] error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['rviz', 'urdf', 'launch', 'meshes', 'resource'].
[0.589s] 
[0.589s] To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
[0.589s] setuptools will not proceed with this build.
[0.589s] 
[0.590s] If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
[0.590s] on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
[0.590s] Instead, consider the following options:
[0.590s] 
[0.590s] 1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
[0.590s] 2. use a `src-layout`
[0.590s] 3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
[0.590s] 
[0.590s] To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
